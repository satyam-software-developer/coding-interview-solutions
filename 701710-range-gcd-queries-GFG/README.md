## Medium
Given an integer array arr[] and a 2D array queries[][] containing q queries, where each query is one of the following two types:Type 1: [0, l, r] -&gt; Return the GCD of all elements in the range [l, r] (both inclusive).Type 2: [1, index, value] -&gt; Update arr[index] to value.Return an array containing the answers to all Type 1 queries in the order they appear in queries[][].Note: Use 0-based indexing.Examples:Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16], q = 3, queries[][] = [[0, 0, 2], [1, 3, 8], [0, 2, 5]]
Output: [1, 4]
Explanation: Initially, arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16].
Query [0, 0, 2]: Find the GCD of the subarray arr[0...2] = [2, 3, 4]. The GCD is 1.
Query [1, 3, 8]: Update arr[3] from 6 to 8. The array becomes [2, 3, 4, 8, 8, 16].
Query [0, 2, 5]: Find the GCD of the subarray arr[2...5] = [4, 8, 8, 16]. The GCD is 4.
Therefore, the answers to all Type 0 queries are [1, 4].
Input: arr[] = [12, 18, 24, 30, 36], q = 4, queries[][] = [[0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 15], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 4]]Output: [6, 3, 3]Explanation: Initially, arr[] = [12, 18, 24, 30, 36].Query [0, 1, 3]: Find the GCD of the subarray arr[1...3] = [18, 24, 30]. The GCD is 6.Query [1, 2, 15]: Update arr[2] from 24 to 15. The array becomes [12, 18, 15, 30, 36].Query [0, 0, 2]: Find the GCD of the subarray arr[0...2] = [12, 18, 15]. The GCD is 3.Query [0, 2, 4]: Find the GCD of the subarray arr[2...4] = [15, 30, 36]. The GCD is 3.Therefore, the answers to all Type 0 queries are [6, 3, 3].Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ q ≤ 1050 ≤ l, r, index ≤ arr.size()-11 ≤ arr[i], value&nbsp;≤ 105
