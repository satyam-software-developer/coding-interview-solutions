# [Secret Cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/secret-cipher--141631/1)
## Hard
Geek wants to send a secret message to his friend Keeg. Instead of sending the original message directly, he encrypts it by inserting the character '*'.
Keeg decodes the message as follows:

 Traverse the encoded string from left to right and initialize the original string as empty.
Whenever a normal character appears, append it to the current original string.
 Whenever '*' is encountered, remove it and append all characters before it to the end of the current original string. 
 Repeat until no '*' remains. 

 
Given the original string s, find the lexicographically smallest encrypted string that decodes to s.
Examples :
Input: s = "ababcababcd"
Output: ab*c*d
Explanation: We can encrypt the string in following way : "ababcababcd" -&gt; "ababc*d" -&gt; "ab*c*d"

Input: s = "zzzzzzz"
Output: z*z*z
Explanation: The string can be encrypted in 2 ways: "z*z*z" and "z**zzz". Out of the two "z*z*z" is smaller in length.
Constraints:&nbsp;1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105
