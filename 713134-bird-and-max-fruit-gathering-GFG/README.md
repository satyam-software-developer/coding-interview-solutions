# [Bird and Max Fruit Gathering](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bird-and-maximum-fruit-gathering--170645/1)
## Easy
Given an array arr[] representing the fruit values of trees arranged in a circle and an integer m, find the maximum total fruits the bird can collect by visiting at most m trees.

Bird can start from any tree and move to a neighboring tree. 
The first and last trees are also considered neighbors. 
The bird collects the fruit value of every tree it visits.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 1, 4], m = 3Output: 9
Explanation: The bird can start from the second tree and visit the second, third, and fourth trees.The total fruit value collected is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4], m = 2Output: 8
Explanation: The bird can start from the second tree and visit the second and third trees, collecting 6 + 2 = 8. It can also start from the fourth tree and visit the fourth and fifth trees, collecting 5 + 3 = 8. The maximum total fruit value is 8.

Input: arr[] = [7, 2, 1, 3, 4], m = 2Output: 11
Explanation: The bird can start from the fifth tree and visit the fifth and first trees, collecting 4 + 7 = 11. These trees are neighbors because the trees are arranged in a circle. The maximum total fruit value is 11.
