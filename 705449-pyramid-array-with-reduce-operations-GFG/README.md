# [Pyramid Array with Reduce Operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pyramid-form3044/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] consisting of stones, where arr[i] represents the height of the i-th stone. 

You need to transform the stones into a pyramid by only reducing the heights of the stones. Reducing the height of a stone by 1 costs 1 unit, and stones cannot be increased or moved. 
A valid pyramid consists of a contiguous subarray whose heights follow the pattern:&nbsp;1, 2, 3, ..., x - 1, x, x - 1, ..., 2, 1 for some positive integer x. 
Every stone outside this subarray must have a height of 0.

 
Find the minimum total cost required to build a pyramid. It is guaranteed that at least one valid pyramid can always be formed.
Examples: 
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can obtain the array [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0] by subtracting 2 out of 4, 1 out of 2, and 1 out of 1. In total, we will subtract 4.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already in pyramid form.
