# [Negative Weight Cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/negative-weight-cycle3504/1)
## Medium
Given a weighted directed graph containing V vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1 and a list of E directed edges edges[][], determine whether the graph contains a negative weight cycle or not. 
Each edge is represented as: [u, v, w], where there is a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v having the given weight w.
Note: A negative-weight cycle is a cycle in a graph whose edges sum to a negative value.
Examples:
Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 3, 6], [1, 0, 4], [1, 2, 6], [3, 1, 2]]
Output: false
Explanation: Cycle 1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 1 has total weight 6 + 4 + 2 = 12, which is positive, so no negative weight cycle exists.
Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[1, 0, 4], [3, 1, -2], [1, 2, -6], [2, 3, 5]]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 1 with total weight -3, which is negative, so a negative weight cycle exists.
