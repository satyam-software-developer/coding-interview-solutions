# [Minimum Cost Selection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/buying-vegetables0016/1)
## Medium
Given an n × 3 matrix mat[][], where each row represents the costs of three available choices at a shop, select exactly one choice from each row such that the same choice is not selected in two adjacent rows. 
Return the minimum total cost required.
Examples:
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 50, 50], [50, 50, 50], [1, 50, 50]]
Output: 52
Explanation: One optimal selection is- Row 1: Choice 1 (Cost = 1), Row 2: Choice 2 (Cost = 50), Row 3: Choice 1 (Cost = 1)
Total cost = 1 + 50 + 1 = 52.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 4, 1], [3, 2, 2], [3, 2, 3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One optimal selection is- Row 1: Choice 1 (Cost = 1), Row 2: Choice 2 (Cost = 2), Row 3: Choice 3 (Cost = 2)
Total cost = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
