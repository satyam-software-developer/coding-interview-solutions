# [Construct a Full Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/construct-a-full-binary-tree--170648/1)
## Medium
Given two arrays pre[] and preMirror[] of size n containing unique elements, where pre[] represents the preorder traversal of a full binary tree and preMirror[] represents the preorder traversal of its mirror tree, construct the original full binary tree using these traversals.
Note: A general binary tree cannot be uniquely constructed using these two traversals. However, a full binary tree can be constructed uniquely from the given traversals without any ambiguity.
Examples:
Input: pre[] = [0,1,2], preMirror[] = [0,2,1] Output: [0, 1, 2]Explanation: The tree will look like
       
Input: pre[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7], preMirror[] = [1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 5, 4]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7]Explanation: The tree will look like
