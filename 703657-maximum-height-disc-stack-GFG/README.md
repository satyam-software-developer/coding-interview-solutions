# [Maximum Height Disc Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/stacking-up-discs1315/1)
## Hard
Given two arrays r[] and h[] of size n, where r[i] and h[i] represent the radius and height of the i-th circular disc, respectively. A disc can be placed above another disc only if both its radius and height are strictly smaller than those of the disc below it. Find the maximum possible height of a stack that can be formed using the given discs. Each disc can be used at most once.Examples:Input: r[] = [5, 7, 3], h[] = [6, 5, 4]
Output: 10
Explanation: The discs (3, 4) and (5, 6) form a valid stack. Therefore, the maximum possible height is 4 + 6 = 10.Input: r[] = [3, 7], h[] = [7, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Neither disc can be placed above the other because both required dimensions are not strictly smaller. Therefore, the maximum possible height is 7.
