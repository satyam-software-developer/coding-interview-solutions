# [Subsets with Products of Distinct Primes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/game-of-subsets/1)
## Hard
Given an integer array arr[], count the number of different subsets whose product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers.&nbsp; Two subsets are considered different if the set of chosen array indexes are not same.
Return the count modulo 109 + 7.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subsets are:
[2], product = 2 = 2
[3], product = 3 = 3
[1, 2], product = 2 = 2
[1, 3], product = 3 = 3
[2, 3], product = 6 = 2 × 3
[1, 2, 3], product = 6 = 2 × 3
All these products can be expressed as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers. Hence, the count is 6.Note that [4] or any other subset with 4 are not chosen because prducts having 4 have repeated primes 2.
Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: Since subsets formed using different indices are considered different, the chosen subsets are:
[2] (using the first 2)
[2] (using the second 2)
[3]
[2, 3] (using the first 2)
[2, 3] (using the second 2)
Each subset has a product that can be expressed as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers. Therefore, the answer is 5.
