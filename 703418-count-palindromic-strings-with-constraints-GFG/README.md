# [Count Palindromic Strings with Constraints](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-palindromic-strings2706/1)
## Medium
Given two integers n&nbsp; and k, consider an alphabet consisting of the first k lowercase English letters. Find the number of palindromic strings whose length is less than or equal to n, such that:

Every character in the string belongs to the given alphabet.
No character appears more than twice in the string.

Note: Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9+7.
Examples:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible strings are: "a", "b", "aa", "bb", "aba", "bab".
Input: n = 4, k = 3
Output: 18
Explanation: The possible strings are:"a", "b", "c", "aa", "bb", "cc", "aba", "aca", "bab", "bcb", "cac", "cbc", "abba", "acca", "baab", "bccb", "caac", "cbbc". 
Constraints:1 ≤ k ≤ 261 ≤ n ≤ 52n ≤ 2*k
